      <h4>How we built it</h4>
      <p>
        The project can be divided into two parts: the fetcher and the analyzer. The fetcher is a web crawler written with Python and fetches playersâ€™ data such as names and scores from UTR and ATP Tour. The fetched data are stored as .csv files and can be read by the analyzer.

        The analyzer is a GUI program written with C#. It reads the .csv files, cross-references player data from UTR and ATP Tour, and generates unified player entries, removing players based on age limits. Then, based on the unified entries, the analyzer calculates a rank/score (called MyRank) based on UTR scores, ATP rankings, and user-defined weights.

        All players' data are displayed in a list, sorted by MyRank in descending order to help coaches to identify prospects. Country statistics, such as average UTR, ATP, and MyRank of a country, are also presented for coaches to identify big opportunity areas.
